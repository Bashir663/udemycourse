    <h2>Top few best animes imo!</h2>

    <h3>1. Re:zero</h3>
    <p>
      This anime hit me hard, so many times i lost count. The first season is a
      masterpiece, ESPECIALLY its ending HOLY JESUS I almost cried. I was close
      to tearing up a couple times as well throughout it. Love Rem. She deserves
      everything.

      Second season was amazing as well. I really felt the mans' struggle and
      almost ending himself was way too close. But the way he changes after all
      that nonsese, just makes me wanna do some shit. Sad that there is nothing
      about Rem though.

    <h3>2. Attack on Titan</h3>
    <p>
      This shit ain't even done sending banger after banger. Got me fucked up
      with the season 3 end. Entire world as we know it crumbling apart and
      reforming.

    <h3>3. Danganronpa</h3>
    <p>
      The animes, and the games especially. Bangers all around except the 2.5
      special episode or whatever. Absolutely loved seeing the detective shit go
      wild and crazy ass plans and figuring them out in the games.

    <h3>4. The Promised Neverland (First season only)</h3>
    <p>
      fuckass second season was just a whole load of baloney. First episode of
      first season gets you hella hooked and the characters become lovable. I
      wouldn't watch it again tho lul.
